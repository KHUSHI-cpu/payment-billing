System analysis is a process of gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems and the information to recommend improvements on the system. It is a problem solving 
activity that requires intensive communication between the system users and system developers. System analysis or study is an important phase of any system development process. 
The system is studied to the minutest detail and analyzed. The system analyst plays the role of the interrogator and dwells deep into the working of the present system. 
The system is viewed as a whole and the input to the system are identified. The outputs from the organizations are traced to the various processes. System analysis is 
concerned with becoming aware of the problem, identifying the relevant and decisional variables, analyzing and synthesizing the various factors and determining an optimal 
or at least a satisfactory solution or program of action.
 A detailed study of the process must be made by various techniques like interviews, questionnaires etc. The data collected by these sources must be scrutinized to 
 arrive to a conclusion. The conclusion is an understanding of how the system functions. This system is called the existing system. Now the existing system is subjected
 to close study and problem areas are identified. The designer now functions as a problem solver and tries to sort out the difficulties that the enterprise faces. The 
 solutions are given as proposals. The proposal is then weighed with the existing system analytically and the best one is selected. The proposal is presented to the user 
 for an endorsement by the user. The proposal is reviewed on user request and suitable changes are made. This is loop that ends as soon as the user is satisfied with 
 proposal. 
Preliminary study is the process of gathering and interpreting facts, using the information for further studies on the system. Preliminary study is problem solving activity that requires intensive communication between the system users and system developers. It does various feasibility studies. In these studies a rough figure of the system activities can be obtained, from which the decision about the strategies to be followed for effective system study and analysis can be taken.
